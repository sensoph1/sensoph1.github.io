Originally when i installed Jekyll, i used the one built in to the Ubuntu repos. This installed an old version and as much as i researched i couldn't figure out how to update that binary. I finally discovered it was an issue with rbenv and what it had in my path that was preventing me from using hte most current version (or even a version newer than 2.4). Rather than figure out what the path should be i decided to reinstall it.

#### **disclaimer** im sure this isnt the recomended method but it worked for me and i didnt really have anything critical anyway. ####

First step i did was to rename .rbenv to .rbenv-old 

 {% highlight bash %}
$ mv .rbenv .rbenv-old 
{% endhighlight %}

Then with the assistance of a guide from [Janne Cederberg](http://jannecederberg.fi/2015/11/25/installing-node-using-nvm-and-jekyll-using-rbenv-on-ubuntu-14-04/) i reinstalled rbenv.

since i had previously installed rbenv i didnt need to do any prereqs but check out that link if you have any issues.

from what ive discovered my ubuntu uses bashrc for the path so this guide reflects that.

### Installing RBENV and RUBY ###

First we get a clone of rbenv and put it in a hidden folder called rbenv and then add it to your path.

{% highlight bash %}
git clone git://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv.git ~/.rbenv
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'eval "$(rbenv init -)"' >> ~/.bashrc
{% endhighlight %}

Next we install the ruby build plugin that helps with installing different versions of ruby on unix based systems

{% highlight bash %}
git clone git://github.com/sstephenson/ruby-build.git ~/.rbenv/plugins/ruby-build
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/plugins/ruby-build/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
{% endhighlight %}

Finally we install ruby. I installed version 2.2.3 since its what i had prior and i didnt have time to research if i should upgrade further.

{% highlight bash %}
rbenv install -v 2.2.3
rbenv global 2.2.3
{% endhighlight %}

now i was able to finally run the following to install jekyll

{% highlight bash %}
gem install jekyll  
{% endhighlight %}

i just let it go to the latest but if you would rather you can specify which version of jekyll to use 

{% highlight bash %}
gem install jekyll -v 2.4.0
{% endhighlight %}

Then I Built a new jekyll site so i could have all the benefits of the new features.

{% highlight bash %}
jekyll new website
{% endhighlight %}

The final step is to reconfigure the _config.yml, and and bring in / edit various pages from the old directory and previous posts. So far so good.
