Hi, I'm Jeremy Barkley. I am a Systems admin for OpenVMS and RedHat Linux systems and freelance web developer living in the Texas Panhandle. I have had an interest in web development and design since as far back as high school when I built a website with some friends. The technology has changed a lot and that actually makes me very happy. 



In my free time (when i can find it), I also enjoy creating objects in 3d using Blender 3d, as well as CrossFit, and spending time with family outdoors.
